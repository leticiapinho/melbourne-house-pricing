AIMF Exemplary
Activity:
This analysis is part of the work carried out in the Exemplaria course.
Lesson on predictive models and how to use the data to feed them Task:
generate a predictive model for the selling price of homes in the City of Melbourne (Canada). The dataset contains information from 2016-2018 for 34,858 households. Details on the meaning of each column are available in the file data_description_Melbourne.txt.
These data are real data mined from the site https://www.domain.com.au/ and made available in Kaggle at the link https://www.kaggle.com/anthonypino/melbourne-housing-market.

What should be done:
Exploratory data analysis
Data cleaning
Data visualization
Modeling
In the modeling stage you are free to choose the predictive tool to be used. However, it should come with performance metrics, discussion of results and examples of predictions (e.g. how much would it cost to buy a 2 bedroom house in Reservoir on 49 Lithgow St with 02 rooms in June 2017?).
